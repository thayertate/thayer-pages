  <h1>Erosion Issue Report – 2760 Interlaken Drive</h1>
  
  <p>We are Thayer and Lori Tate at <strong>2760 Interlaken Drive</strong>, and we are reporting an ongoing erosion and runoff issue caused by an uphill neighbor’s yard, which has been disturbed by recent or ongoing construction.</p>

  <h2>Issue Summary</h2>
  <p>
    Due to the construction, the neighbor's yard has turned into a mud and gravel slick. Every time it rains, runoff flows down the sidewalk and the channels on both sides, depositing a significant amount of gravel, mud, and dirt onto our cobblestone driveway.
  </p>

  <h2>Observed Impacts</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Cobblestone is sinking</strong> in our driveway, likely due to soil erosion beneath. Our downstream neighbor's cobblestone section, behind the county sewer, has already fallen in the past couple of weeks.</li>
    <li><strong>Dirt buildup is killing the grass</strong> where it rolls off the driveway and into the yard.</li>
    <li><strong>Loose gravel causes tire spinouts</strong> when entering or exiting our driveway—especially for my wife’s vehicle.</li>
    <li><strong>Gravel is being kicked up onto our vehicles,</strong> raising concerns about paint damage and dents.</li>
    <li><strong>Driveway cleanup is required every two weeks,</strong> involving brooming and sometimes heavy effort due to the gravel load.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps Already Taken</h2>
  <p>
    We have:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Spoken to the neighbor and requested installation of a silt fence. He declined and mentioned possibly placing blocks instead. He doesn’t appear motivated to resolve the issue.</li>
    <li>Contacted our HOA for assistance. They confirmed this falls outside their jurisdiction and directed us to report the issue to the County.</li>
    <li>Temporarily broomed the top layer of gravel into the street, but refrained from rinsing it into the sewer to preserve visibility for your inspection.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Photo Evidence</h2>
  <p>Below are several photos taken after recent rain events showing the extent of the gravel and mud accumulation:</p>

  <h2>Request for Assistance</h2>
  <p>
    We are asking for County assistance to address the runoff and erosion problem before additional property damage occurs. In our view, the simplest short-term solution would be to require the neighbor to install a <strong>silt fence</strong> or other sediment control barrier until permanent grass or landscaping is re-established.
