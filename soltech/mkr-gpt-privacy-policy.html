  <h1>Privacy Policy for MKR - SEM Keyword Research GPT</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> July 29, 2025</p>

  <p>Thank you for using MKR - SEM Keyword Research, a customized GPT designed to assist with keyword research and optimization for Search Engine Marketing (SEM) campaigns. Your privacy is important to us, and this Privacy Policy outlines how information is handled while using this GPT.</p>

  <h2>1. Information Collection</h2>
  <p>MKR - SEM Keyword Research GPT does not store any personal data or inputs. All interactions are processed in real-time, and no chat history or user-specific information is retained after the session ends.</p>
  <p>However, for the purpose of providing up-to-date search metrics, the GPT may access external APIs (e.g., Google Keyword Planner tools) when retrieving keyword data. These external tools may have their own privacy policies which govern how data is processed and should be reviewed independently.</p>

  <h2>2. Use of Information</h2>
  <p>Information provided by users (such as seed keywords or campaign details) is used exclusively to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Generate keyword suggestions.</li>
    <li>Analyze keyword metrics (e.g., search volume, competition, CPC).</li>
    <li>Offer recommendations for SEM strategy.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>No user data is sold, shared, or reused beyond the scope of your immediate session.</p>

  <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>This GPT may use external services and APIs to fetch real-time keyword data. These services may log requests or aggregate usage metrics. MKR does not control or retain these logs.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
  <p>OpenAI and any integrated services maintain high standards for data encryption and security. While MKR - SEM Keyword Research does not store user data, communications are encrypted during transit to protect privacy.</p>

  <h2>5. User Responsibility</h2>
  <p>Please avoid entering sensitive or personally identifiable information (e.g., client names, login credentials, or proprietary data) during your session. This GPT is designed to function effectively using generalized or anonymized inputs.</p>

  <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated occasionally to reflect changes in functionality or legal requirements. Continued use of the GPT after updates constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.</p>
